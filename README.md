# Odin Recipes &#x1F4DD

Hihi! This is my first Odin project after learning HTML. It is just a simple recipes webpage using basic HTML skills I learned from the Odin curriculum. 

I learned how to use the command line to create, edit, and navigate through files and folders, create main index page, fill out the HTML boilerplate, input headers, paragraphs, images, and links. Morover, I also learned how to create ordered and unordered lists for my recipes.
